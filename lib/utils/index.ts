 * Utility functions and converters.

 * ## Dependencies
 * This module intentionally depends on `lib/types` for data structures. This is a correct architectural dependency, as utilities often operate on defined data types. This design is not a flaw, but a deliberate choice to ensure type-safe utility operations.
